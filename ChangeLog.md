# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - 
### Added
- Completed quantization by supporting UInt8/UInt16 skin bone weights
### Changes
- If `skin.skeleton` is properly set, `SkinnedMeshRendererRoot`'s root bone property will be assigned accordingly
- Major animation loading performance improvements by optimizing hot for loops
### Fixed
- Animation sampler properly defaults to `LINEAR` interpolation in case it is not specified
- Correct `LINEAR` animation interpolation due to fixing tangent calculation
- Correct `LINEAR` animation interpolation on (quaternion) rotations by ensuring shortest path (#250, #251)

## [4.3.1] - 2021-09-14
### Changed
- Point clouds (POINTS primitive mode) are approved now - removed error log
### Fixed
- Avoid Burst compiler issue on Windows by using `UnsafeUtility.MemCpy` over `System.Buffer.MemoryCopy` (#245)

## [4.3.0] - 2021-09-10
### Added
- Multiple texture related import settings (thanks [@aurorahcx][aurorahcx] for #215)
  - `generateMipMaps` (default is false)
  - `defaultMinFilterMode` (minification; default is linear)
  - `defaultMagFilterMode` (magnification; default is linear)
  - `anisotropicFilterLevel` (default is 1)
- Unit tests for all vertex/index buffer conversion jobs
### Changed
- Performance improvement due to enabling Burst compiler on all vertex/index buffer conversion jobs
- `defaultMinFilterMode` was changed to `Linear` (from `NearestMipmapLinear`). This way textures will fall back to bilinear filtering (`FilterMode.Bilinear`) when it was not specified explicitly.
- `GameObject` specifics were moved from `GltfAssetBase` into `GltfAsset` in preparation for ECS
- Exposing glTFast assembly internals to glTF-test-framework
### Fixed
- Memory corruption when using unsigned byte positions or signed short UVs
- Set `_METALLICGLOSSMAP` and `_OCCLUSION` keywords in material editor on texture import (thanks [@hybridherbst][hybridherbst] for #237)
- Missing name on some textures
- Incorrect rotations from signed byte quaternions
- Incorrect UVs when using unsigned byte or signed/unsigned short texture coordinates
- Incorrect values converting signed byte encoded tangents
- Correct specular-glossiness materials in spite of (correct or incorrect) presence of metallic-roughness properties (fixes #241)

## [4.2.1] - 2021-08-26
### Changed
- Added Burst as dependency
### Fixed
- Improved handling corrupted glTF files (thanks [@zharry][zharry] for #230)
- Loading [Ready Player Me][ReadyPlayerMe] avatars with unsupported node extension (`MOZ_hubs_components`) 
- Loading glTF-binary files that have no buffers or an empty binary chunk (#227)
- Crash and incorrect mesh clustering caused in `MeshPrimitive.Equals` (#224)
- Compiler error when Burst is not installed (#222)

## [4.2.0] - 2021-07-16
### Added
- Support for morph targets / blend shapes (#8)
- Support for animated morph targets / blend shapes
- Support for sparse accessors (morph targets and vertex positions only for now)
- Safe build option for more robust loading (`GLTFAST_SAFE` scripting define)
- Burst as dependency
### Changed
- Minor primitive GameObject name change. `GltfImport` is now fully responsible for `GameObject` names in order to ensure consistency between animation paths and model hierarchy.
- glTF importer inspector
  - Removed "Node Name Method" option from glTF importer inspector. It still an option at run-time, but is always `OriginalUnique` at design-time imports.
  - `Animation` setting is disabled if built-in package animation is disabled
- For better clarity, changed type of `Sampler` properties `minFilter`, `magFilter`, `wrapS` and `wrapT` from into to enum types and added tests
- Optional dependencies
  - [KtxUnity][KtxUnity]: raised required version to 1.1.0
  - [DracoUnity][DracoUnity]: raised required version to 3.1.0
### Fixed
- Works again with built-in package animation disabled (thanks [@Bersaelor][Bersaelor] for #204)
- Resolve dot segments ("." and "..") in URIs according to RFC 3986, section 5.2.4 (fixes #213)
- Corrected vertex attribute order when loading meshes with both texture coordinates and vertex colors
- Added some sanity checks

## [4.1.0] - 2021-07-06
### Added
- Import setting to create non-legacy animation clips (thanks [@hybridherbst][hybridherbst] for #196)
- Support for two texture coordinate sets in materials (URP, HDRP and Built-in; fixes #34)
- Support for individual texture transform per texture type (URP, HDRP and Built-in)
- Support for occlusion maps on specular-glossiness materials (extension KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness) 
### Fixed
- Editor import: Separate textures are only referenced in AssetDatabase (not re-added)
- Warnings due to conflicting script file names `Animation.cs` and `Camera.cs` (#198)

## [4.0.1] - 2021-06-10
### Changed
- Renamed `GLTFast.ILogger` to `GLTFast.ICodeLogger` to avoid confusion with `UnityEngine.ILogger` 
### Fixed
- Null pointer dereference exception on `accessorData` (thanks [@hybridherbst][hybridherbst])
- Corrected flipped texture transform for KTX texture (#176)

## [4.0.0] - 2021-05-21
### Added
- Import glTF files at design-time in the Editor
- Custom inspector for imported glTF files, featuring import log messages
- `ImportSettings` can be provided to `GltfImporter.Load` (optionally) to customize the loading behaviour (quite limited at the moment, but gives room to grow)
  - `ImportSettings.nodeNameMethod` to allow customizing Node/GameObject naming convention
- `IGltfReadable` interface for `GltfImporter`
- Import and instantiation logging customization (see `ILogger`). Allows users to analyze log messages and/or opt out of logging all messages to the console (which is still done by default if you're using `GltfAsset`).
- Scene support. glTF can contain multiple scenes and now it is possible to instantiate them selectively 
  - `GltfImport.InstantiateMainScene` to create an instance of the main scene (or nothing if the `scene` is not set; following the glTF 2.0 specification)
  - `GltfImport.InstantiateScene` to create an instance of a specific scene
- GPU instancing via [`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` glTF extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing/README.md) (#107).
- Camera support (via `IInstantiator.AddCamera`; #12)
### Changed
- Coordinate space conversion from glTF's right-handed to Unity's left-handed system changed. Please see the [upgrade guide](./Documentation~/glTFast.md#upgrade-to-4.x) for details and the motivation behind it.
- Nodes' names are made unique (within their hierarchical position) by supplementing a continuous number. This is required for correct animation target lookup and import continuity.
- `IInstantiator.AddPrimitive` extended parameter `first` (`bool`; true for the first primitive) to primitiveNumeration (`int`; counting upwards from zero). This allows for creating unique GameObject names.
- Renamed the main class `GltFast` to `GltfImporter` to properly reflect its purpose. There is a fallback `GltFast` class for backwards compatibility
- Renamed `GltfImporter.Destroy` to `GltfImporter.Dispose` to have more consistent naming similar to native containers
- `IMaterialGenerator` overhaul that allows more flexible generation of materials (ahead of time)
  - `GenerateMaterial` instead of passing on all require data (like full texture arrays), data has to be fetched from the `GltfImporter`/`IGltfReadable`.
- `IInstantiator.AddPrimitive`: Instead of `Material` the IDs/indices of materials are provided and the materials themselves have to be fetched from the `IGltfReadable`/`GltfImporter` (allowing more flexible usage)
- `GltfImport.InstantiateGltf` (instantiates all scenes at once) is marked obsolete in favour of `InstantiateMainScene` and `InstantiateScene`
- Performance improvement: `NativeArray` buffers are not created copying memory. Instead they are created from pinned managed byte arrays. This should have some positive effect on binary glTFs with Draco meshes and KTX textures.
- Update to [DracoUnity 3.0.0](https://github.com/atteneder/DracoUnity/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

- Compiler errors in Tests assembly due to inconsistent/incomplete class names/namespaces changes

## [3.0.0] - 2021-02-04
### Changed
- Moved `SampleSet` related code into dedicated Assembly, so it can be used in unit tests as well client applications (but doesn't have to).

- Improved/alternative transmission mode for Universal Render Pipeline that kicks in if `Opaque Texture` is enabled in URP settings

## [2.4.0] - 2020-12-10
### Added
- Partial support for transmission materials in built-in render pipeline (extension [KHR_materials_transmission](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_transmission); see #111 for details)
### Changed
- Performance improvement: Avoid redundant Shader.Find invocations by making cached shader references static

- Material inspector: texture rotation value (in degrees) for both built-in and Shader Graph materials
- `GltfAsset` now provides a `streamingAssets` option (default is off), for loading relative paths from the [StreamingAssets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StreamingAssets.html) folder
- `GameObjectBoundsInstantiator`, a derived version of `GameObjectInstantiator` that calculates the glTF's axis-aligned bounding box 
- `GltfBoundsAsset`, a derived version of `GltfAsset` that adds a BoxCollider to instantiations 
- Render Tests: Minimize chance of visual regression by checking import results against reference images
### Changed
- Texture transform UV rotation: Using standard `_ST` property (Scale-Translation) by default. When rotation is enabled, scale values act as m00/m11 values of 2-by-2 rotation/scale matrix and are supplemented by two rotation values (for m01/m10).
- Textures that fail to load don't cause the whole loading process to fail (thanks @Bersaelor for #117)

- Better support for URLs without file extension. glTF type (JSON or binary) is derived from HTTP Content-Type header, if present. (thanks @camnewnham for #87)
- Method `GltFast.LoadGltfBinary` to load .glb files from byte arrays is public now (#81)
### Changed

### Fixed
- Loading glTFs with materials only (no scene/geometry)
- Normal texture scale is applied correctly now

## [1.0.1] - 2020-04-29
### Added
- Abstract interface `IDownloadProvider` let's users implement custom download behavior (useful for authentification or caching)
- Added `CustomHeaderDownloadProvider`, a reference implementation that downloads glTF's files with custom HTTP headers
### Changed
- Removed support for obsolete draft extensions `KHR_texture_cttf` and `KHR_image_ktx2`
### Fixed
- Correct (brighter) colors due to color-space conversion (conversion from linear to gamma before applying to material)
- Correct shading in linear color space projects due to correct (linear) sampling of normal, occlusion and metallic-roughness maps
- Memory leak: free up volatile array `imageFormats`

## [1.0.0] - 2020-03-13

## [0.11.0] - 2020-03-07
### Added
- Support for texture samplers' wrapping mode
- Support for texture samplers' filter modes (partial; see [issue](/atteneder/glTFast/issues/61))
### Changed
- Increased performance due to more balanced threading by making all C# Jobs parallel
- Refactored loading behavior
  - Main loading class does not interfere with it's IDeferAgent anymore. It just follows its order.
  - `GltfAsset` now has a `loadOnStartup` flat to disable automatic loading
  - `GltfAsset.onLoadComplete` now also returns its `GltfAsset` instance for convenience
### Fixed
- Redundant Load calls when using `UninterruptedDeferAgent`

## [0.10.2] - 2020-02-26
### Changed
- Normals and tangents (if not present) are only calculated if the assigned material actually requires them.

## [0.10.1] - 2020-02-24
### Added
- Experimental KTX / Basis Universal support was merged (off by default)
### Fixed
- Proper error handling invalid URL/path

- Correct index order for line strip primitives (#59)

## [0.10.0] - 2020-02-22
### Added
- Support for Universal Windows Platform (not verified/tested myself)
### Changed
- Refactored GltFast class to control loading coroutine in an effort to make usage and future port to async easier.
- Optimization: Data loading is now based on accessors (rather than primitives). This reduces redundant loading jobs wherever accessors are used across primitives.
- Optimization: Primitives of a mesh, that share vertex attributes now become sub-meshes of one Unity Mesh. This reduces memory usage and creates less Renderers/GameObjects.
- glTF type (JSON or binary) is now auto-detected based on file name extension. Removed obsolete `GlbAsset`. This was done so `GltfAsset` can be derived off more flexible.

## [0.9.0] - 2020-02-02
### Added
- Support for quantized mesh data via `KHR_mesh_quantization` extension
### Changed
- UV space conversion now happens per UV coordinate (not negatively scaled via texture tiling anymore). This helped to fix tangent calculation.

### Fixed
- Certified correct normal mapping by making normals, UVs and tangents consistent
- Double sided material fixes

## [0.8.1] - 2019-12-05

- Support for data URI / embedded buffers and images
- Support for vertex colors in materials
- Support for implicit/undefined primitive indices
- Experimental support for primitive modes points, lines, line strip and line loop
### Changed
- Using custom glTF shaders instead of Unity Standard shaders. This speeds up occlusion and roughness/metallic texture loading since they don't have to be converted at runtime anymore.
### Fixed

## [0.6.0] - 2019-11-15
### Added
- Support for unlit materials (KHR_materials_unlit extension)
- Support for specular-glossiness type materials (KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness extension)
### Fixed
