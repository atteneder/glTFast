<sup>1</sup>: Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) material model

<sup>2</sup>: Two sets of texture coordinates (as required by the glTF 2.0 specification) are supported, but not three or more ([issue][UVSets])

<sup>3</sup>: There are two approximation implementations for transmission in Universal render pipeline. If the Opaque Texture is enabled (in the Universal RP Asset settings), it is sampled to provide proper transmissive filtering. The downside of this approach is transparent objects are not rendered on top of each other. If the opaque texture is not available, the common approximation (see <sup>4</sup> below) is used.

<sup>4</sup>: Transmission in Built-In and HD render pipeline does not support transmission textures and is only 100% correct in certain cases like clear glass (100% transmission, white base color). Otherwise it's an approximation.

### Material Export

Material export is currently only tested on the following shaders:

- Universal and High Definition render pipeline
  - `Lit` 
  - `Unlit` 
- Built-In render pipeline
  - `Standard` 
  - `Unlit` 

Other shaders might (partially) work if they have similar properties (with identical names).

## Data-Oriented Technology Stack

> ⚠️ Note: DOTS is highly experimental and many features don't work yet. Do not use it for production ready projects!

Unity's [Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)][DOTS] allows users to create high performance gameplay. glTFast has experimental import support for it.

Instead of traditional GameObjects, glTFast will instantiate Entities with Hybrid Renderer (version 2) components.

Possibly incomplete list of things that are known to not work with Entities yet:

- Animation
- Skinning
- Morph targets
- Cameras
- Lights

### DOTS Setup

- First, go through the official [DOTS project setup](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/manual/install_setup.html)
- Make sure to enable [Hybrid Renderer V2](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.rendering.hybrid@0.11/manual/creating-a-new-hybrid-renderer-project.html)
- Use `GltfEntityAsset` instead of `GltfAsset`
- For customized behavior, use the `EntityInstantiator` instead of the `GameObjectInstantiator`

## Unity Version Support

*glTFast* requires Unity 2019.4 or newer.
